# hello-world
This is my first repository in Git Hub. I hope I will progress from this point. 
I am a student of Computer Science and I am very excited to learn abput Python very soon. Learning about GitHub is part of my journey to learn Python. I am very excited to share this news with all the web. Cheers!
